# nora

Nora is a programming language with the purpose of experimienting with Truffle and Graal.
Their are many dynamic typed languages out their on truffle and i wanted to do something different.
Thus nora is a statically typed functional language with multi dispatch (as I have not seen that combination yet).
Despite being statically typed multi method dispatch can still highly benefit from a JIT.

The focus is on the vm part.
The language is not intended to be used at least not yet, especially the compiler has poor quality. 
A better one is in works, but is not finished and will stay that way until I have more time for this project.
